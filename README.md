### Hello there! 👋
I am a Dad and a restless spirit. A Cloud-Addict with a strong focus on Security and Free Software. I prefer  at Home and Linux around. I am a convinced -Fanboy, and, besides, love Metal of all kind, Travelling, Photographing, Reading and Blogging.

- 🔭 Always working on articles and in-depths that are related to the OS above and all Cloud-driven solutions with privacy in mind
- 🌱 Always learning, trying to get the big whole
- 🪂 Often disjointed but easy to thrill when it comes to discover something new
- Currently exploring the Fediverse with <a rel="me" href="https://social.pifferi.io/@oliver">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://pix.pifferi.io/oliver">Pixelfed</a>, <a href="https://tube.pifferi.io/c/oliverpifferi/videos">PeerTube</a> and <a href="https://books.pifferi.io/user/oliver">BookWyrm</a>.
